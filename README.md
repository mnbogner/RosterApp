# RosterApp

Intended as a replacement to my previous 40k roster app.  This new version allows users to create and view army rosters. The app looks for json codex files in the download directory and saves json army files in the external storage directory. Future goals include
 - implement additional validation of unit and item counts
 - move common weapons and items into their own tables
 - improve ui
